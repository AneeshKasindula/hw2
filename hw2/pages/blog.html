        <p> What ethical considerations justify the concealment of the source speaker's identity in audio deepfakes, especially when this technology is used for creating innovative content?
            A: The inquiry into why research is important in obscuring the identity of the source speaker, despite a large primary use of generative models for audio creation in entertainment, for example, does raise ethical considerations. Speech does not contain the information only about “who you are?” (identity) or “what you are speaking?” (content); it encapsulates a myriad of sensitive information including age, gender, accent, current health, and even cues about the upcoming future health conditions. For instance, our recent research paper on “Detecting Dementia from Long Neuropsychological Interviews” demonstrates the feasibility of detecting dementia from speech with considerably high accuracy.</p>
